# Feature Specification: Taskify Enhanced Kanban Board System

**Feature Branch**: `002-taskify-kanban`  
**Created**: 2025-07-19  
**Status**: Draft  

---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Executive Summary *(mandatory)*

The Enhanced Kanban Board System extends Taskify's core task management capabilities with advanced visual workflow management, real-time collaboration features, and sophisticated drag-and-drop interactions. This enhancement transforms the basic task list view into an interactive kanban board that supports multiple board layouts, custom workflows, swimlanes, and advanced filtering. The system enables product managers and teams to visualize work progress more effectively, collaborate in real-time, and customize their workflow management to match their specific processes.

## Problem Statement *(mandatory)*

While the basic Taskify application provides essential task management functionality, teams need more sophisticated visual workflow management capabilities. Current limitations include: lack of visual progress tracking across workflow stages, inability to customize workflow columns beyond basic status, no support for parallel work streams (swimlanes), limited real-time collaboration features, and insufficient visual indicators for bottlenecks and work distribution. Teams require an enhanced kanban system that supports complex project workflows and enables better visual management of work in progress.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Stories (must have)
- **US-001**: As a product manager, I want to create custom kanban boards with configurable columns so that I can match my team's specific workflow stages
  - **Happy Path**: Navigate to board settings ‚Üí Add/remove/rename columns ‚Üí Set column WIP limits ‚Üí Save configuration ‚Üí Board updates with new layout
  - **Edge Case**: Invalid column names or WIP limits - show validation errors and prevent save
  - **Test**: Verify custom columns appear correctly and WIP limits are enforced during task moves

- **US-002**: As a team member, I want to drag and drop tasks between columns with real-time updates so that status changes are immediately visible to all team members
  - **Happy Path**: Select task ‚Üí Drag to new column ‚Üí Drop task ‚Üí All connected users see update immediately ‚Üí Task status updates in database
  - **Edge Case**: Network interruption during drag operation - show reconnection status and queue operation for retry
  - **Test**: Verify multiple users see real-time updates and no task data is lost during network issues

- **US-003**: As a product manager, I want to organize tasks into swimlanes by assignee, priority, or project so that I can better visualize work distribution
  - **Happy Path**: Select swimlane grouping option ‚Üí Board reorganizes into horizontal lanes ‚Üí Tasks remain draggable within and between lanes
  - **Edge Case**: Tasks without assigned values - place in "Unassigned" swimlane with clear visual indication
  - **Test**: Verify swimlane organization works correctly and tasks maintain proper relationships

- **US-004**: As a team member, I want to see visual indicators for WIP limits and bottlenecks so that I can identify workflow problems quickly
  - **Happy Path**: Column reaches WIP limit ‚Üí Visual warning appears ‚Üí Additional tasks cannot be moved to column ‚Üí Clear indication of blocked state
  - **Edge Case**: WIP limit changes while column is at capacity - update indicators and handle overflow appropriately
  - **Test**: Verify visual indicators appear correctly and drag operations are properly restricted

### Secondary User Stories (nice to have)
- **US-005**: As a product manager, I want to filter the kanban board by multiple criteria so that I can focus on specific work items
  - **Journey**: Open filter panel ‚Üí Select multiple filter criteria (assignee, priority, due date, tags) ‚Üí Board updates to show only matching tasks
  - **Test**: Verify filters work correctly in combination and board performance remains acceptable

- **US-006**: As a team member, I want to see task details in a quick preview without leaving the board so that I can access information efficiently
  - **Journey**: Hover over task card ‚Üí Quick preview popup appears ‚Üí View details, comments, attachments ‚Üí Close preview to continue board work
  - **Test**: Verify preview loads quickly and doesn't interfere with drag operations

### Critical Test Scenarios
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Multiple users moving tasks simultaneously must see consistent state without conflicts or lost updates
- **Performance**: Board with 500+ tasks must load within 3 seconds and drag operations must complete within 500ms
- **Data Integrity**: Task positions, column assignments, and metadata must remain consistent across all users and browser sessions
- **Responsive Design**: Kanban board must function properly on mobile devices with touch-based drag and drop
