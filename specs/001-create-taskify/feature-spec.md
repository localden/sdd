# Feature Specification: Taskify - Team Productivity Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-taskify`  
**Created**: 2025-07-09  
**Status**: Draft  

---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Executive Summary *(mandatory)*

Taskify is a team productivity platform that enables teams to manage projects through Kanban-style boards with drag-and-drop task management, team collaboration, and assignment tracking. The platform provides immediate visual feedback on project progress and individual workloads, streamlining team coordination and task prioritization. This MVP version focuses on core functionality without authentication to validate the essential workflow patterns before adding complexity.

## Problem Statement *(mandatory)*

Teams need a simple, visual way to track project progress and coordinate task assignments without the complexity of enterprise project management tools. Current solutions often require extensive setup, authentication complexity, and feature bloat that slows down adoption and daily use. Teams need an intuitive Kanban interface that allows immediate task status updates, clear assignment visibility, and collaborative commenting without barriers to entry.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Stories (must have)
- **US-001**: As a team member, I want to select my identity from a predefined list so that I can access the platform and see my assigned tasks
  - **Happy Path**: Open app ‚Üí Select user from list ‚Üí View projects dashboard ‚Üí See assigned tasks highlighted
  - **Edge Case**: Multiple team members using same device - clear user selection process
  - **Test**: Verify user selection persists during session and assigned tasks are visually distinct

- **US-002**: As a team member, I want to drag tasks between Kanban columns so that I can update task status efficiently
  - **Happy Path**: Click task ‚Üí Drag to new column ‚Üí Release ‚Üí Status updates automatically
  - **Edge Case**: Network interruption during drag - graceful handling with retry or rollback
  - **Test**: Verify task moves between all column combinations and status persists

- **US-003**: As a team member, I want to comment on tasks so that I can collaborate with my team on specific work items
  - **Happy Path**: Open task ‚Üí Add comment ‚Üí Submit ‚Üí Comment appears with timestamp and author
  - **Edge Case**: Long comments, special characters, concurrent comments from multiple users
  - **Test**: Verify comment threading, edit/delete permissions, and real-time updates

### Secondary User Stories (nice to have)
- **US-004**: As a team member, I want to reassign tasks to other team members so that I can balance workload
  - **Journey**: Open task ‚Üí Select assignee from dropdown ‚Üí Confirm assignment ‚Üí Task updates visually
  - **Test**: Verify assignment changes reflect in UI and assigned user sees task in their color

- **US-005**: As a team member, I want to see project overview with task counts so that I can understand project status at a glance
  - **Journey**: View project list ‚Üí See task counts per column ‚Üí Identify bottlenecks or progress
  - **Test**: Verify counts update as tasks move between columns

- **US-006**: As a team member, I want to explore different project types and activity levels so that I can understand various workflow scenarios
  - **Journey**: Browse projects ‚Üí View "Mobile App Redesign" (high activity) ‚Üí See many active tasks ‚Üí Switch to "Team Onboarding System" (low activity) ‚Üí See mostly completed tasks
  - **Test**: Verify each project shows distinct activity patterns and realistic task distributions

### Critical Test Scenarios
- **Error Recovery**: Task drag operations fail gracefully, comments save properly or show error, task assignments revert if update fails
- **Performance**: Drag and drop operations respond within 100ms, project loading completes within 2 seconds
- **Data Integrity**: Task status changes persist correctly, comments maintain authorship, no duplicate tasks created during operations

  - Team Onboarding System (low activity, 20 tasks)
- **Task**: Work item with title, description, status (To Do/In Progress/In Review/Done), assignee, and comment collection
  - Each task must have realistic titles and descriptions appropriate to its project context
  - Tasks must be distributed across all four status columns to demonstrate workflow progression
  - Task assignments must vary across users to show different workload scenarios
- **Comment**: User feedback on tasks with content, author, timestamp, and edit/delete permissions

### Non-Functional Requirements *(optional - only if performance/scale critical or storing user data)*
- **Performance**: Task drag operations complete within 100ms, project loading within 2 seconds
- **Scale**: Supports 5 concurrent users across 3 projects with up to 50 tasks per project
- **Reliability**: Local data persistence - no data loss during browser refresh or short network interruptions
- **Security**: No authentication required - data stored locally without sensitive information
- **Constraints**: Must work in modern browsers, responsive design for desktop/tablet use, no offline capability required

- User registration or account creation
- Project creation or deletion
- Task creation or deletion
- Real-time collaboration (live updates)
- Mobile app version

## Technical & Integration Risks *(optional - only if significant risks exist)*

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Drag-and-drop operations may be inconsistent across different browsers
  - **Mitigation**: Test on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and implement fallback UI

- **Risk**: Local storage limitations may cause data loss with large task collections
  - **Mitigation**: Monitor storage usage and implement data cleanup for old/completed tasks

### Performance Risks
- **Risk**: UI may become sluggish with many simultaneous drag operations
  - **Mitigation**: Implement debouncing and optimize DOM updates during drag events

- **Risk**: Comment threading may impact performance with many comments per task
  - **Mitigation**: Implement comment pagination or lazy loading for tasks with >20 comments
