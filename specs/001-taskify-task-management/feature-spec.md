# Feature Specification: Taskify Task Management Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-taskify-task-management`  
**Created**: 2025-07-19  
**Status**: Draft  

---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Executive Summary *(mandatory)*

Taskify is a web-based task management application designed specifically for product managers to organize, track, and collaborate on their work. The application provides intuitive task creation, status tracking, priority management, and team collaboration features to help product managers maintain oversight of their projects and deliverables. This tool will increase productivity by centralizing task management and reducing the time spent coordinating across multiple tools and communication channels.

## Problem Statement *(mandatory)*

Product managers currently juggle multiple tools, spreadsheets, and communication platforms to track their tasks and coordinate with teams. This fragmented approach leads to missed deadlines, unclear priorities, difficulty in progress tracking, and poor visibility into team workload. A dedicated task management solution tailored to product management workflows will streamline work organization and improve team coordination.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Stories (must have)
- **US-001**: As a product manager, I want to create and organize tasks so that I can track all my work responsibilities in one place
  - **Happy Path**: Login ‚Üí Create new task ‚Üí Set title, description, priority, due date ‚Üí Save task ‚Üí Task appears in dashboard
  - **Edge Case**: Network failure during save - show error message and allow retry with local data preservation
  - **Test**: Verify task creation with all fields populates correctly in task list and can be retrieved

- **US-002**: As a product manager, I want to update task status and priority so that I can maintain current progress visibility
  - **Happy Path**: Select task ‚Üí Change status (To Do/In Progress/Done) ‚Üí Update priority ‚Üí Save changes ‚Üí Dashboard reflects updates
  - **Edge Case**: Conflicting updates from team members - show conflict resolution dialog with merge options
  - **Test**: Verify status changes are immediately visible and priority sorting updates correctly

- **US-003**: As a product manager, I want to assign tasks to team members so that I can distribute work and track accountability
  - **Happy Path**: Select task ‚Üí Choose assignee from team list ‚Üí Set due date ‚Üí Send notification ‚Üí Task appears in assignee's view
  - **Edge Case**: Assignee no longer on team - show warning and suggest alternative assignees
  - **Test**: Verify assigned tasks appear in both manager and assignee views with correct notifications sent

### Secondary User Stories (nice to have)
- **US-004**: As a product manager, I want to filter and search tasks so that I can quickly find specific work items
  - **Journey**: Open dashboard ‚Üí Use search bar or apply filters (status, assignee, priority, date) ‚Üí View filtered results
  - **Test**: Verify search returns relevant results and filters work correctly in combination

- **US-005**: As a team member, I want to see tasks assigned to me so that I understand my responsibilities and deadlines
  - **Journey**: Login ‚Üí View "My Tasks" dashboard ‚Üí See assigned tasks with status and due dates
  - **Test**: Verify only assigned tasks appear and updates from manager are reflected immediately

### Critical Test Scenarios
- **Error Recovery**: System must gracefully handle network failures during task operations, preserving user input and allowing retry without data loss
- **Performance**: Task list loading must complete within 2 seconds for up to 1000 tasks; search results must appear within 1 second
- **Data Integrity**: Task assignments, status changes, and due dates must never be lost; concurrent edits must be properly resolved without overwriting changes

---

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create accounts with email and password authentication
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow task creation with title, description, priority levels (High/Medium/Low), due dates, and assignee selection
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to update task status (To Do, In Progress, Done) and modify task details
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist all task data, user assignments, and status changes with timestamps
- **FR-005**: System MUST send email notifications when tasks are assigned or status changes occur
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide task filtering by status, assignee, priority, and due date ranges
- **FR-007**: System MUST support team management with ability to add/remove team members
- **FR-008**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: data retention period not specified - indefinitely, or specific timeframe?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide task search functionality across title and description fields

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents product managers and team members with authentication credentials, profile information, and team associations
- **Task**: Core work item with title, description, priority, status, due date, creation/modification timestamps, and assigned user relationships
- **Team**: Collection of users working together, with team lead designation and member management capabilities
- **Notification**: System-generated alerts for task assignments, status changes, and due date reminders

### Non-Functional Requirements *(optional - only if performance/scale critical or storing user data)*
- **Performance**: Task operations (create, update, delete) complete within 1 second; dashboard loading completes within 2 seconds for up to 1000 tasks
- **Scale**: Supports 100 concurrent users with up to 50 teams of 20 members each
- **Reliability**: 99.5% uptime during business hours with graceful degradation during maintenance
- **Security**: All user data encrypted in transit and at rest; secure password requirements; session management with automatic timeout
- **Constraints**: Must work in modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge); responsive design for mobile and tablet access

---

## Integration Points *(optional - only if external systems involved)*

**External Systems**:
- Email Service: Sends notification emails for task assignments and status changes; requires SMTP configuration or email service API
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Calendar integration not specified - should tasks sync with calendar applications?]

**Events & Notifications**:
- Task Assignment: Triggered when task is assigned to team member; notifies assignee via email
- Status Change: Triggered when task status is updated; notifies task creator and stakeholders
- Due Date Reminder: Triggered 24 hours before due date; notifies assignee and manager
- Team Invitation: Triggered when user is added to team; sends welcome email with login instructions
