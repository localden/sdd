# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  

---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Executive Summary *(mandatory)*

[2-3 sentence overview of what this feature does for users and the business value it provides]

## Problem Statement *(mandatory)*

[Brief description of the problem and why it needs to be solved]

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Stories (must have)
- **US-001**: As a [user], I want to [action] so that [value]
  - **Happy Path**: [Step 1] ‚Üí [Step 2] ‚Üí [Success]
  - **Edge Case**: [What could go wrong and how to handle]
  - **Test**: [How to validate this story works]

- **US-002**: As a [user], I want to [action] so that [value]
  - **Happy Path**: [Step 1] ‚Üí [Step 2] ‚Üí [Success]
  - **Edge Case**: [What could go wrong and how to handle]
  - **Test**: [How to validate this story works]

- **US-003**: As a [user], I want to [action] so that [value]
  - **Happy Path**: [Step 1] ‚Üí [Step 2] ‚Üí [Success]
  - **Edge Case**: [What could go wrong and how to handle]
  - **Test**: [How to validate this story works]

### Secondary User Stories (nice to have)
- **US-004**: As a [user], I want to [action] so that [value]
  - **Journey**: [Brief flow description]
  - **Test**: [Basic validation approach]

- **US-005**: As a [user], I want to [action] so that [value]
  - **Journey**: [Brief flow description]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

### Non-Functional Requirements *(optional - only if performance/scale critical or storing user data)*
- **Performance**: [Action] completes within [time] for [load]
- **Scale**: Supports [number] concurrent [users/operations]
- **Reliability**: [Availability/uptime requirement]
- **Security**: [Data protection requirement]
- **Constraints**: [Hard technical boundaries, e.g., must work offline, browser limitations]

---

## Integration Points *(optional - only if external systems involved)*

**External Systems**:
- [System 1]: [what data flows in/out, any constraints]
- [System 2]: [what triggers/events, API limitations]

**Events & Notifications**:
- [Event 1]: Triggered when [condition]
- [Event 2]: Notifies [who] about [what]

---

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Functional Validation
- [ ] All user stories pass acceptance testing
- [ ] All functional requirements work end-to-end
- [ ] External integrations verified in test environment

### Technical Validation
- [ ] Performance: [e.g., "Search results return within 2 seconds"]
- [ ] Load: [e.g., "System handles 1000 concurrent users"]
- [ ] Error handling: All failure scenarios recover gracefully
- [ ] Data integrity: No data loss under normal and edge conditions

### Measurable Outcomes
- [ ] [e.g., "User task completion time reduced by 50%"]
- [ ] [e.g., "Support tickets decreased by 30%"]
